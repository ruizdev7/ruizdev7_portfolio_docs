## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for implementing a dropdown menu within the Black Lantern platform. 
This menu will display the catalog of available courses, providing users with an organized and accessible way to navigate and explore educational content. 
The implementation aims to enhance user experience by ensuring intuitive navigation, dynamic content updates, and compliance with accessibility standards.

### 1.2 Scope
The dropdown menu functionality will provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to navigate the "Learning Catalog" section of the application. 
It will allow users to view and select courses organized hierarchically into categories, modules, and submodules. The menu will support dynamic content loading, 
ensuring that updates to the catalog are reflected in real-time. Additionally, the dropdown menu will adhere to accessibility standards, 
ensuring usability for all users, including those with disabilities. This feature aims to enhance the user experience by simplifying navigation 
and improving the discoverability of educational content.

The dropdown menu will be integrated into the **top navigation bar** of the course catalog section on the platform. 
It will provide users with a **quick preview** of available courses, categorized by subject areas, without 
requiring a full-page reload.  

### 1.3 Key Features in Scope  
- **Navigation Efficiency:** Users can browse courses seamlessly without disrupting their workflow.  
- **Categorization:** Courses will be grouped into predefined subject areas for easier exploration.  
- **User Accessibility:** The menu will be accessible via both mouse and keyboard navigation.  
- **Dynamic Content:** The menu should update dynamically based on the latest course offerings.  
- **Limited Course Display:** Each category will display a maximum of **three** courses, along with a **link to explore the full list** of courses within that category.  

### 1.4 Out of Scope  
- **Course Enrollment:** The dropdown menu will not handle course registration; it is strictly for exploration.  
- **Full Course Details:** Users must navigate to the course page for comprehensive information.  


### 1.5 Definitions
Below are key terms used in this document to ensure clarity and consistency.  

- **Dropdown Menu:** A UI component that expands when interacted with, displaying a list of options.  
- **Navigation Bar:** The top section of the platform that contains primary navigation links.  
- **Course Catalog:** A section of the platform where available courses are listed and categorized.  
- **Category:** A predefined grouping of related courses.  
- **Dynamic Content:** Information that updates in real-time based on available data.  
- **Exploration Link:** A link in the dropdown menu that redirects users to the full list of courses within a category.
