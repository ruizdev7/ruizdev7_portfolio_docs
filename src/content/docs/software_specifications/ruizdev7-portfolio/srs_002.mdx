## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the implementation of a Blog and Posts Management System in the ruizdev7 Portfolio application.  
The objective is to provide a flexible content management solution that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, manage categories, and view featured content with proper authorization controls.

### 1.2 Scope  
The Blog/Posts Management System includes the following components:  

- **Post CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete functionality for blog posts.  
- **Category Management**: Organize posts into categories for better content organization.  
- **Slug-Based Routing**: SEO-friendly URLs using automatically generated slugs.  
- **Featured Posts**: Highlight the most recent or important posts.  
- **Random Post Selection**: Display random posts for content discovery.  
- **Author Attribution**: Associate posts with user accounts.  
- **Post Table View**: Administrative interface for managing all posts.  
- **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based access control for content management.  

The implementation ensures:  
- Data integrity through SQLAlchemy ORM  
- SEO optimization with slug-based URLs  
- Scalable content structure  
- Integration with the authentication system  

### 1.3 Definitions  
- **Post**: A blog article containing title, content, author, category, and metadata.  
- **Slug**: A URL-friendly string derived from the post title (e.g., "my-first-post").  
- **Featured Post**: The most recent or manually selected post displayed prominently.  
- **Category**: A classification tag for organizing related posts.  
- **Author**: The user who created the post.  
- **Published At**: Timestamp indicating when the post was published.
