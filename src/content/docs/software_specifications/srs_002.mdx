## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the implementation of the "My Learning" view in the Black Lantern application.  
The objective is to provide users with a centralized interface to track their ongoing courses, achievements, and upcoming assignments.  
The view will enhance user experience by offering two visualization modes (card and list) for courses in progress, a section for completed course badges, and a component for upcoming assignments.

### 1.2 Scope  
The "My Learning" view will include the following components:  

- **Courses in Progress**: Display all courses currently in progress with two visualization modes: card and list.  
- **Achievements**: Showcase badges earned for completed courses.  
- **Upcoming Assignments**: Display reminders for upcoming meetings or activities assigned during the courses.  

The implementation will ensure compliance with privacy regulations, including:  
- PIPEDA for Canadian user data  
- GDPR for European user data  
- Ley 1581 for Colombian user data  

### 1.3 Definitions  
- **Card View**: A visual representation of courses in a card format, showing key details like course name, progress, and instructor.  
- **List View**: A tabular representation of courses with sortable columns for details like progress and deadlines.  
- **Badges**: Visual indicators representing achievements for completed courses.  
- **Upcoming Assignments**: A list of scheduled meetings or reminders for activities assigned during the courses.
