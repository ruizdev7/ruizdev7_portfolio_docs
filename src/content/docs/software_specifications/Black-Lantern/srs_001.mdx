## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the implementation of the Black Lantern login system. 
The objective is to ensure secure and role-specific access to the application, complying with Canadian (PIPEDA), 
European (GDPR), and Colombian (Ley 1581 de 2012) privacy regulations.  
The role-based access control (RBAC) system will allow user permissions to be managed, 
ensuring that each user has access only to the functions necessary for their specific role. 
This includes user management, application configuration, and regulatory compliance.  

The RBAC system will be implemented using a "least privilege" approach, meaning users will receive 
only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. 
This will help reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect sensitive company and user information.

### 1.2 Scope  
The login system will handle the authentication and authorization processes of users, 
ensuring that each user has access only to the functions necessary for their specific role, aiming to:  

- Allow users to register  
- Permit access to registered users  
- MFA  
- Encrypted session logs retained for 6 months  
- Region-specific compliance:  
	- PIPEDA for Canadian user data  
	- GDPR for European user data  
	- Ley 1581 for Colombian user data  

### 1.3 Definitions  
- **RBAC**: Access control based on predefined roles.  
- **PIPEDA**: Canadian privacy law governing personal data handling.  
- **GDPR**: European regulation for data protection and privacy.  
- **Ley 1581**: Colombian statutory law regulating personal data processing.  
- **Least Privilege**: Users receive minimal permissions needed for their role.
