It's been five years since I started using Docker in production. Over time, I've become familiar with its API for packaging and distributing my applications. Daily use—whether writing a Dockerfile, running containers, or debugging issues—makes you internalize its API, which is actually quite intuitive.

I'll group the commands according to their use:

## Docker Installation and Setup

<Aside>There are several ways to install Docker on your operating system. For absolute clarity, don't hesitate to check the [Docker Docs - Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ "title").</Aside>

1. **docker --version**

   ```sh
   docker --version
   ```
   Shows the installed version of Docker on your system.

2. **docker info**

   ```sh
   docker info
   ```
   Provides detailed information about your Docker installation, including containers, images, and system configuration.

3. **docker login**

   ```sh
   docker login
   ```
   Allows you to authenticate with a Docker registry (such as Docker Hub) so you can push or pull private images.

## Docker Images

4. **docker pull**
   ```sh
   docker pull <image_name>
   ```
   Downloads an image from a Docker registry to your local machine.

5. **docker images**
   ```sh
   docker images

   ```
   Lists all Docker images stored locally.

6. **docker rmi**
   ```sh
   docker rmi <image_id>
   ```
   Removes a Docker image from your local machine.

7. **docker build**
   ```sh
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   ```
   Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

## Docker Containers

8. **docker run**
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>
   ```
   Creates and runs a new container from an image. Useful flags include:
    * `-d --detach`: runs the container in the background and prints the container ID
    * `--name <container_name> <image_name>`: creates a container from the selected image and assigns it a name.

9. **docker ps**
   ```sh
   docker ps

   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED      STATUS                PORTS                                            NAMES

   ```
   Shows the containers currently running.

10. **docker ps -a**

    docker ps -a
    ```
    Lists all containers, including those that are stopped.

11. **docker stop**
    ```sh
    docker stop <container_id>
    ```
    Stops a running container.

12. **docker start**
    ```sh
    docker start <container_id>
    ```

13. **docker restart**

    docker restart <container_id>
    ```
    Restarts a container (stops and starts it again).

14. **docker rm**
    ```sh
    docker rm <container_id>
    ```
    Removes a container (it must be stopped first).

15. **docker exec**
    ```sh
    docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
    ```
    Runs a command inside a running container (for example, opens a bash terminal).

## Docker Volumes

16. **docker volume create**
    ```sh
    docker volume create <volume_name>
    ```
    Creates a new Docker volume for persistent data storage.

17. **docker volume ls**

    Shows detailed information about a specific volume.

19. **docker volume rm**

## Docker Networks

20. **docker network create**

    docker network create <network_name>
    ```
    Creates a new Docker network.

21. **docker network ls**
    ```sh

    Shows detailed information about a specific network.

23. **docker network connect**

    ```
    Connects a container to an existing network.

24. **docker network disconnect**
    ```sh
    docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>
    ```
    Disconnects a container from a network.

## Docker Compose

25. **docker-compose up**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
    Builds, creates, starts, and attaches the services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

26. **docker-compose down**
    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```
    Stops and removes the containers, networks, images, and volumes defined by `docker-compose.yml`.
